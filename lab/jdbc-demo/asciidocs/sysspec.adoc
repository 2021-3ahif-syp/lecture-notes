== Description of the Initial Situation
Currently, finances are mainly viewed via the web interfaces of the respective banks, which often do not record all accounts and payments, only store the data for a limited timespan, and have a limited availability of categories.

== Current State
Currently, data is stored for a limited amount of time.
There's also a lack of categories in modern e-banking systems, that prevents the user from properly viewing their finances.
Furthermore, spatial or temporal delimitation can't be performed.

Finoview is set to solve these issues by importing the bookings, adding categories as well as the ability to perform spatial or temporal delimitation.

== Problem definition
It is hard to do spatial or temporal delimitation manually and as e-banking systems don't provide a solution to this problem and also limit users in the way of categorizing their bookings, this program aims to solve these issues.

== Task
Our task is to develop a program that makes it easier to view your
finances and categorize them as well as doing spatial and temporal delimitations.

=== Functional requirements

* Payments can be inserted
* Payments can be booked
* Payments can be delimited by space and time

Non-Functional requirements

//==== Transferability
//==== Maintainability
//==== Efficiency
//==== Functionality
==== Reliability
The calculations are accurate

==== Usability
The program is user-friendly and easy to understand

== Objective
The objective is to know at what time and for what cause money was spent or received.

== Quantity structure
The program needs to store the data that is inserted by the user as
well as the calculated bookings.
